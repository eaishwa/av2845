This project is aimed at understanding how regression can be employed to predict sale price of houses from the Ames Housing dataset. I had tried linear, lasso and ridge regression on the dataset and analysed the behaviour of all the three. I have explored the dependence of the regularization parameter alpha on the validation score. I have also visualized feature importances.
